This is a social media app I made for my family. I wanted to use my skills to create a project that feels personal so I made this to grow closer with my family.

## Optimizations

I will be adding more features and upgrading the styling as time go on. Addition features would be adding a text type post, messaging feature, the ability to have profile pictures, stories, etc. Styling would include using a more complex color theme.

## Lessons Learned:

There were many aspects of the app that I learned throughout building process. One of which was incorporating authorization for users using Passport.js. I'm glad to have learned it because now I can have authorization for future projects. This app also helped me deepen my knowledge of the MVC architecture.
